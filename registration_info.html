    The Oracle Exam is administered at official testing centers. <br> Depending on which center you choose,
    you can pretty much schedule the test for whatever date and time works best for you. <br>
    Here is a link to the website where you can schedule the test: <br>

    We don't have a specific testing center that we refer to our students, but most of them go to Janus Networks, <br>
    located at 10225 Barnes Canyon Rd, #A201 San Diego, CA 92121.<br>

    If the test taker is under 18, they will need a guardian to sign a waiver in order for them to take the test. <br>
    Here is the link to the waiver: <br>
