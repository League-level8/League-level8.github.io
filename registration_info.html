The Oracle Exam is administered at official testing centers. Depending on which center you choose, 
you can pretty much schedule the test for whatever date and time works best for you. 
Here is a link to the website where you can schedule the test:

We don't have a specific testing center that we refer to our students, but most of them go to Janus Networks, 
located at 10225 Barnes Canyon Rd, #A201 San Diego, CA 92121.

If the test taker is under 18, they will need a guardian to sign a waiver for him to take the test.
